# DESCRIPTION
- A model based on **LightGBM Classifier to detect credit defaults** has been developed using data from a US financial institution. Balanced class weights were applied to mitigate class imbalance.
  - The first notebook, `1_Preprocessing.ipynb`, covers from the target definition to data preprocessing.
  - The second notebook, `2_Modeling.ipynb`, contains the modeling and evaluation phase.
  - Finally, the **trained model has been deployed in a web application** where real-time predictions can be made.
