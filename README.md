A **binary classification machine learning model** has been developed to more easily **identify delinquent or non-paying customers**. Additionally, the trained model has been integrated into a web application where anyone can calculate credit risk along with the estimated most relevant feautures for the prediction by inputting the required characteristics into the model.
